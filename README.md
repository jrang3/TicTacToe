# TicTacToe
Descriptions/Features of My Project
- I built a two player tic tac toe game in C++. Players would enter a number 1-9 where each number corresponds to a position on the board. The game goes on until a person gets 3 in a row in any direction. 

Motivation For Project
- What motivated me to do this project was that I was researching for a project to work on, and I came across creating a Tic Tac Toe game. I thought it would be interesting to work on the Tic-Tac-Toe Project. 

Difficulties Ran Into
- I didnâ€™t really have many difficulties with this project. I thought it was pretty straightforward of a project to work on.

How to Run Program
Type in clang++ -std=c++20 -Iincludes ./src/main.cc ./src/tictactoe.cc and then ./a.out
